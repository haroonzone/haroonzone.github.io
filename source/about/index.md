This is Haroon Rasheed's software testing blog.

Over the last decade or so I've been a tester, QA, Test Lead, Technical Tester and Coach/Mentor. I am a strong advocate of agile, DevOps and Continuous Delivery practices.

I mostly program in JVM based programming languages (java, groovy, scala) but regularly try to find the best possible solution for the problem and developing them using python or ruby.

I contributed to [Tellurium](https://code.google.com/p/aost/).
